The official app by Facebook for Android is a big bunch of bad coded code which makes your phone slow and uses very very much storage and much of your data plan.

A good and small alternative to this app is *Toffeed for Facebook*, developed by *Jake Lane* and fully open sourced and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JakeLane/Toffeed).

The app is just 1.2 MB big and uses only a few permissions (and only necessary ones - in contrast to the official app). It's a wrapper so it'll show the mobile version of the Facebook page in a WebView but it also allows image uploading, location sharing and notifications.

If you want to give it a try, download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.jakelane.wrapperforfacebook) or if you want to help improving the app check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/JakeLane/Toffeed).
