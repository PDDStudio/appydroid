What do you like the most on Android? Is it the great design, the great and active community, the amount of well created open source apps?

It doesn't matter! It seems like you love Android!

![Feature Image]({{ site.url }}/img/1.jpg)

Because I'm myself developer for Android too (next too my student activities) I thought I want to contribute something to the community of Android entusiasts.

Today I want to present **appydroid**, the first open sourced online news magazine about Android apps.

#### What does *Open Source* in this context mean?

**Open Source** means **Open Source**:

* Everyone should be able to add new content to appydroid
* Everyone should be able to contribute to the development of appydroid
* Everyone should be able to redistribute this site

To learn more about this read the article [Open Source](/open-source).

#### Contents of appydroid

Every news magazine (don't care about online or printed) has a topic. The topic of appydroid is the big field of **Android apps**. This includes:

* App reviews
* App news
* App tutorials
* and much more...

#### How to contribute to appydroid

Contributing should be as easy as possible. To enable this appydroid is organized like this:

* appydroid is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the blogging system [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which generates static websites
* To write new articles only a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join) is needed
* You don't need anything installed on your PC except a text editor and a browser
* You should have basic knowledge in managing git repositories, how to fork repositories and howto create pull requests
* You should know how to write in Markdown

To learn more about this read the article [Contibute](/contribute).
