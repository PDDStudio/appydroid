Libraries are designed to make a developer's life during development easier.
 Since the ammount of Android developers is getting bigger and bigger the ammount of available libraries is contineously growing, too.

Searching for a library that fits your needs might cost you important hours which you could've spend into development.
Therefore [*Vladislav Bauer*](https://github.com/vbauer) created an awesome [website](http://android-arsenal.com/) (Android-Arsenal) which is contineously growing in it's ammount of showcased libraries, bundeled into categories, which makes it easier for everyone to find, share and use the libraries you're looking for.

All showcased libraries and applications are open-sourced and available on GitHub, Bitbucket, or similar repository hosters.
