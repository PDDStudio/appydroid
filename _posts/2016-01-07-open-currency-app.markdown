Did you ever visited a country with another currency in your home country? How did you manage the currency problem?

The last summer I traveled around Europe with a friend and we also visited countries like Hungary where they haven't the â‚¬uro. We always had to believe the exchange rates the bank automat showed us.

To solve this problem I founded with another Android developer the [*OpenAppsProject*](https://github.com/OpenAppsProject/). The OAP should be a community of Android developers who love to code Open Source apps.

**OpenCurrency** is the first project. The still very small app helps you convert any currency in any other currency based on the always up-to-date exchange rates given from the European Central Bank.

But I suggest you to try it yourself!

***If you want to help developing OpenCurrency feel free to contribute to it. It's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenAppsProject/OpenCurrency/).***
