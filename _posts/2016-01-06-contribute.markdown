Contribution to Open Source projects are great things. And to make the things clear before problems come I wrote this little instructions:

With contribution to appydroid I mean the following things:

* Everyone should be able to add new content to appydroid
* Everyone should be able to contribute to the development of appydroid (like the page code etc.)

#### How to contribute to appydroid

Contributing should be as easy as possible. To enable this appydroid is organized like this:

* appydroid is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the blogging system [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which generates static websites
* To write new articles only a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join) is needed
* You don't need anything installed on your PC except a text editor and a browser and a local installed Jekyll version is recommended too
* You should have basic knowledge in managing git repositories, how to fork repositories and howto create pull requests
* You should know how to write in Markdown

To add some new articles or to modify anything on appydroid itself:

* Fork the repository
* Make your changes like writing an article
* Commit the changes to your own fork
* Create a pull request via GitHub

If you want to write an article use any of the files in the *_post* folder as template.

**Every article will be checked before publishing! You do not have any rights that your article will be published on appydroid!**

#### What you have to care about:

You should care about the following things:

* Do not use anything from others without permission (Do not copy any screenshots from apps etc.)
* You are responsible for the articles you write
