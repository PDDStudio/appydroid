Do you sleep well during the night? How long do you sleep? How long are you in deep sleep? Track all this with *Sleep as Android*.

Just two weeks ago I discovered this great app. You can track all your sleep very detailed and get even tips how to improve your sleeping (the the screenshots).

You are able to see when exactly you were in which "sleep mode" and how long you were there.

And the best: The app is also an alarm clock, a *clever* alarm clock. It'll analyze when is the best moment to wake you up, so that you're fit the whole day.

I only use it for tracking my sleep, but I really recommend this app for everyone!

If you don't want to buy the pro version immediately, you can first test the app for 14 days.
