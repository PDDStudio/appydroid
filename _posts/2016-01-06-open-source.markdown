I think Open Source is an essential part of keeping a project active. In addition to this I really like networks like [Medium](http://medium.com) which enables everyone to publish own content.

To keep appydroid free and open too I decided to license it under the Apache 2.0 license.

The articles as well as the page code are with this license. This means that you can reuse them but you have to mention it and if you modify anything you have to publish your modifications.
